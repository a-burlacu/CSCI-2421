- **HW 2:** 
  - The program "HW2" creates vector of initialized Student type objects,
    displays the list of Student objects and their attributes,
    creates object of ComparatorName and ComparatorID class,
    passes the vector and function objects to template function,
    and finally displays results of comparison.
  - Contains findMax Template used to find Student with the largest ID and Student with the largest name. Also contains main() function which creates vector of initialized Student type objects, displays the list of Student objects and their attributes, creates object of ComparatorName and ComparatorID class,  passes the vector and function objects to template function, and finally displays results of comparison.


- **HW 4:**
    - The program "HW4" creates a Doubly Linked List,
      performs operations including: add, remove, print, and
      clearing the list.
    - Includes DoublyLinkedList class and Node class to separate functionality
    - Methods include: sorted insert (add()), remove a node (remove()), find index (findk()), clear list (clear()), check if list empty (isEmpty()), sort list in ascending order (sort()), display list in ascending order (print()), display index of specified value contained within list (findPrint())
